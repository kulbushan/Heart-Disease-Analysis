This workbook predicts the probability of heart disease.  I have used Python features to implement heart disease test results.

This is for research purposes only and should not be used to test any actual persons health.

Heart Disease Predication: 
Features: 
1. chest pain type -- 1: typical angina -- 2: atypical angina -- 3: non-anginal pain -- 4: asymptomatic 
2. Highblood pressure (140> and >90 = true- presence of heart disease)
 
function:
1. compute_coa_test() to check the Coronatry Artery test results.
2. compute_arhy_test() to check the Arrhythmias test results.
3. demo() to implement these features.


## File list:
Classes
1. Testarrhythmias.py - to check the Coronatry Artery test results.
2. Testingcoronatryartery.py - to check the Arrhythmias test results
3. Patient.py - to store patient detail
4. Disease.py - used to call the functions that are used to acquire test results and implements all other classes.
